# Detecting Clickbaits (4) - A Practitioner Strategy!


conventional -> transfer learning -> deep learning
At conventional stage: find potential issues e.g. lack of enough 
training data, bias, skewness, noise, etc.
apply simple enhancements such as normalizations, text fixing, 
using different types of classifiers, manual boosting, etc.

Then if needed, move to transfer learning if possible -> again 
figure out potential issues with the data, fixing text encoding, 
etc.

Then if needed, move to deep learning! 

This is recommended for text classification, for other types of 
unstructured data you might want to skip the conventional algos and 
start from transfer learning.
