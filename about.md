Hi! I'm Hadi! I've been in a data science for many years in different companies! I know, data scientist is vague but I've been doing project in all the ranges of DS including EDA, training ML models, doing unsupervised ML, small/big data, big corporations/startups!

I'm planning to write some of the sutff I find useful and I think will help others.
